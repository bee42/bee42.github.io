               <h1>DevOps Gathering Workshops</h1>
              On March 23th we organized some very interesting Docker Workshops as pre-conference workshops to the conference <a href="https://devops-gathering.io/">DevOps Gathering 2017</a>! The attendess had the chance to learn from Docker Captains and experts:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to set up an automated container building pipeline with GitLab/CI?</li>
<li>How to build and deploy multi-arch Linux and Windows Container images?</li>
<li>How to operate Java applications with Docker and Kubernetes?</li>
<li>How to setup Docker Swarm cluster on AWS?</li>
<li>How to develop, test and deploy software in Docker using tools such as Spring-Boot and Gradle?</li>
</ul>

<p>Dealing with new possibilities of software development and deployment with DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud-Computing was practically addressed at the <a href="https://devops-gathering.io/#workshops">DevOps Gathering pre-conference workshops</a>. The attendees had the chance to learn from DevOps experts from companies like RedHat, styracosoft, AutoScout24, Seal Systems and of course bee42 solutions. We are proud to have nearly all german Docker Captains (three!) hold workshops and shared their deep Docker tips and tricks.</p>

<p>In the GitLab/CI Workshop, <strong>Niclas Mietz from bee42 solutions</strong>, showed in the first stage the easy use of GitLab. After this the attendees got an instructed way to build a CI and CD pipeline to deliver her first container on a system. The next stage was to get a deeper knowledge of the architecture and the concepts of the GitLab/CI ecosystem. After finishing these both stages, a new Microservice project got imported and a CI pipeline was built for this Microservice.</p>

<p><strong>Stefan Scherer</strong> from Seal Systems and <strong>Dieter Reuter</strong> from bee42 solutions, <strong>both Docker Captains</strong>, showed new features of the Windows Servers 2016 and its integration to run Docker and Windows Containers. By pulling Docker images from the Docker Hub and run it on the Docker Engine, attendees learned to configure TCP/IP ports and volumes to connect running container to the outside world.
Successfully taking an application based upon microservices and dockerize it into a set of Windows containers, was the goal of the workshop.</p>

<p><strong>Roland Huss from RedHat</strong> showed his attendees how to add two connected Microservices based on Wildly-Swarm and Spring-Boot, Roland demonstrated live the creation of Docker images to Maven builds and how to simplify integration tests by Docker. Running and orchestrating these images on Kubernetes was the second part of the workshop. The integration with the fabric8-maven-plugin was shown in more detail. Finally, the attendees got a good overview how to put several Java applications in containers and how to orchestrate them.</p>

<p><strong>Philipp Garbe from AutoScout24</strong> and <strong>Docker Captain</strong>, showed in his workshop how to run Docker Containers on AWS. In his hands-on workshop he started to guide his attendees through the basic setups with all local requirements and the immutable infrastructure with CloudFormation. Further the attendees learned to run Docker on EC2 (VMs) and how to scale with AutoScaling Groups. Finally, with the setup of Docker Swarm clusters on AWS, everyone was able to deploy and update applications based on Docker Compose v3.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Wittek and Matthias Rottl√§nder, both from styracosoft</strong>, took the attendees through the complete development lifecycle of a simple microservice, using familiar tools such as Spring-Boot and Gradle. Based on practical examples the workshop started with running Spring-Boot Apps inside a Docker container and building Spring-Boot Docker images using Gradle. Using containers for unit and integration tests in Spring-Boot Apps with Spock and Docker and deploying and configuring Spring-Boot microservices using docker-compose, gave an insight to new possibilities of up to date development and testing environments</p>

<p>You can find the full schedule and agenda, all workshops and talks of the DevOps Gathering 2017 on our website <a href="https://devops-gathering.io/">devops-gathering.io</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you once again to all our Speakers, Docker Daptains, Experts and of course the Attendees! We are looking forward to the next DevOps Gathering and Workshops!</p>
